# PCB-Manufacturing-Project
## Overview
The primary goal of this project was to learn the practical process of creating a simple PCB from the design to the finished working device. It is based off the theory learned in Introduction to Electronics course offered at the University of Oulu and manufactured at the university Fab Lab.

The device itself is a very simple circuit utilizing oscilation function of the 555 timer IC to modulate the frequency of a piezo electric buzzer by adjusting a potentiometer. The initial circuit diagram was provided by the course, however, everything else has been done from scratch including modifying the circuit to use the available Fab Lab components.
